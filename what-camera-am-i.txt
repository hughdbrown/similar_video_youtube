RØDECaster Video live demo and Q&A!
Aaron Parecki
Appears he used 4 HDMI in and 2 HDMI out but not USB-C?
But then at 15:48 he shows ISO recording files of 6 cameras.
And the RCV does not have any XLR mics in use, so how could there be 6 cameras recording? Maybe mics are Rode via Bluetooth?
And at 11:03, there is an overhead shot of the RCV which shows only HDMI ports in use -- no XLR, no USB.

Answering your questions about the RØDECaster Video!
Aaron Parecki
Not mentioned, but there is a question at 04:59
"Can the USB webcam inputs receive other switchers' feed through something like a CamLink or other USB Capture Card?"

Good news is you can connect a cam link or other capture card as long as it supports UVC. I have tested this with a cam link with a USB-C adapter as well as this noname brand UVC capture card with USB-C on the end of it. Both of these work just fine and you can plug in any HDMI source through this as well.  Again, you have to use ports four or five for these; the others do not support webcam inputs so this can give you up to two more HDMI inputs if you really want to.
